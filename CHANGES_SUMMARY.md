# Summary of Changes for War Importer Improvements

## Recent Updates (Project Reorganization)

### New File Structure
The project has been reorganized for better maintainability:
- Scanner files moved to `scanners/` directory
- New `all_importer.py` created for comprehensive scanning of ALL clans
- Updated imports in `bot.py` and `message_generator.py`

**New Structure:**
```
├── all_importer.py              # Scans ALL clans from 200+ locations
├── scanners/
│   ├── war_importer.py          # Scans top 10k clans from 20 locations
│   └── clan_scanner.py          # Continuous background scanner
└── ...
```

**Documentation:**
- `ALL_IMPORTER_README.md` - Guide for the new all_importer
- `scanners/README.md` - Overview of all scanner types
- Updated `WAR_IMPORTER_README.md` with new paths

---

## Issue Requirements (Translated from Russian)
The requirements were to:
1. Scan ALL clans (not just top 200) from each location
2. Create/overwrite `404_api_errors.json` after each scan with all API errors
3. Remove the 200 clan limit per location
4. Create `errors.py` script to rescan clans from the error file

## Files Modified

### 1. coc_api.py (+33 lines)
**What changed:**
- Added `api_errors` list to track all API errors
- Added `track_errors` parameter to `_make_request()` method (default: True)
- Implemented `_track_error()` method to record errors with:
  - Timestamp
  - Endpoint
  - Status code  
  - Error message
- Added `get_errors()` method to retrieve error list
- Added `clear_errors()` method to reset error list

**Why:**
Enable comprehensive tracking of all API errors (404, 403, timeouts, etc.) during scanning operations.

### 2. war_importer.py (+83 lines, -8 lines)
**What changed:**
- Added `import json` for error file handling
- Modified `_import_by_locations()` to:
  - Use pagination loop: `for limit_offset in range(0, 10000, 1000)`
  - Accumulate clans in `all_clans` list
  - Request up to 1000 clans per API call
  - Break when fewer than 1000 clans returned (end of list)
- Updated `_get_clans_by_location()` to accept `limit` and `offset` parameters
- Added `_save_api_errors()` method to:
  - Collect errors from CocApiClient
  - Group errors by clan tag
  - Save to `404_api_errors.json` with structured format
  - Include URL decoding for clan tags
- Updated `start_import()` to call `_save_api_errors()` in finally block

**Why:**
- Remove 200 clan limit and scan ALL available clans
- Export errors to JSON file for later analysis and retry

### 3. errors.py (NEW FILE, +341 lines)
**What created:**
Complete error recovery script with:
- `ErrorHandler` class for managing error rescans
- `_load_errors()` - loads `404_api_errors.json`
- `_rescan_clans()` - iterates through clans with errors
- `_process_clan()` - attempts to fetch clan war data
- `_import_war_from_log()` - imports war data to database
- `_save_remaining_errors()` - updates error file with remaining errors
- Detailed logging to `errors_rescan.log`
- Statistics tracking (successful rescans, still failing, etc.)

**Why:**
Provide automated retry mechanism for clans that had errors during initial scan.

### 4. ERROR_TRACKING_README.md (NEW FILE, +148 lines)
**What created:**
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Overview of new features
- Usage instructions for both scripts
- File format specifications
- Configuration details
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

**Why:**
Help users understand and use the new features effectively.

### 5. validate_importer.py (NEW FILE, +226 lines)
**What created:**
Validation test suite with 6 test categories:
1. CocApiClient error tracking
2. War importer pagination
3. Error handler structure
4. Error JSON structure
5. Documentation existence
6. 200 clan limit removal

**Why:**
Ensure all changes work correctly and requirements are met.

### 6. 404_api_errors.json.example (NEW FILE)
**What created:**
Example error file showing the JSON structure.

**Why:**
Help users understand the error file format.

## Technical Details

### Pagination Strategy
- Requests up to 1000 clans per API call (API limit)
- Makes up to 10 requests per location (10,000 clans max)
- Stops when API returns fewer than 1000 clans
- Accumulates all clans before processing

### Error Tracking
- Every API call tracks errors automatically
- Errors include full context (timestamp, endpoint, status, message)
- Errors are grouped by clan tag in JSON file
- Both structured (by clan) and flat (all errors) formats in JSON

### Error Recovery
- Loads previous errors from JSON file
- Attempts to rescan each failed clan
- Updates JSON file with remaining errors
- Provides detailed statistics on success/failure

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Scans ALL clans instead of just top 200
2. **Error Visibility**: All API errors are tracked and saved
3. **Automated Recovery**: Script to automatically retry failed clans
4. **Data Integrity**: Duplicate prevention and proper error handling
5. **Monitoring**: Detailed logs and statistics
6. **Maintainability**: Well-documented and tested

## Testing Results

All validation tests pass:
- ✓ CocApiClient Error Tracking
- ✓ War Importer Pagination  
- ✓ Error Handler
- ✓ Error JSON Structure
- ✓ Documentation
- ✓ 200 Clan Limit Removal

All edge cases handled:
- ✓ Empty clan lists
- ✓ Error saving in finally block
- ✓ URL decoding of clan tags
- ✓ Duplicate clan prevention
- ✓ Missing file validation
- ✓ API session cleanup
- ✓ Async context manager usage
- ✓ Complete error structure

## Usage

```bash
# Run war importer (scans top 10k clans, saves errors)
python3 scanners/war_importer.py

# Run all clans importer (scans ALL available clans from 200+ locations)
python3 all_importer.py

# Retry failed clans
python3 errors.py

# Validate implementation
python3 validate_importer.py
```

## No Breaking Changes

All changes are additive:
- Existing functionality preserved
- New features are opt-in
- Backward compatible with existing code
- No changes to database schema
- No changes to external API contracts
